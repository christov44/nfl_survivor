This is an NFL Survivors Pool

* Each pool member chooses one NFL team each week. Picks are made 'straight up', not using a point spread system

* Each pool member gets two lives, and loses a life for each incorrect pick

* Two incorrect picks eliminates the player from the pool for the remainder of the season

* Jim Harbaugh will be actively monitoring each pool member's progress
